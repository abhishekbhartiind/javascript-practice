Monolithic Architectures:
If the app is written as a single cohesive (togetherness/attachment/connection) unit of code whose components are designed to work together, sharing the same memory space and resources, is called Monolithic architecture.

Microservice Architectures:
If the app is made up of lots of smaller, independent applications capable of running in their own memory space and scaling independently from each other across potentially many separate machines.
